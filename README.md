# Cat_Clicker

### Purpose

The purpose of this application was to explore the limits of front-end design methods like MVC, MVVM concepts.

### How to Run

THe first version of the Cat_Clicker application came as a self-brewed application for MVC the concept. To look at this file, open up the index.html in the Cat_Clicker repository.

Afterwards, we were able to utilize the Knockout.js framework to better build out the application. The second-version of the application using the framework can be found within the ud989-cat-clicker-ko-starter-master folder. Double click the index.html and open it in a web browser to see.

### Technologies

- Knockout.js
- Javascript
- CSS Grid

### Challenges

The primary challenge of this application was getting the viewmodel to update whenever a different name of the cat was clicked. To work around this, we utilized methods like setCurrentCat, and getCurrentCat so that the view could understand which cat to display whenever one was clicked.
