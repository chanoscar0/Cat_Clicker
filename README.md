# Cat_Clicker

The purpose of this application was to explore the limits of front-end design methods like MVC, MVVM concepts.

THe first version of the Cat_Clicker application came as a self-brewed application for design concepts.

Afterwards, we were able to utilize the Knockout.js framework to better build out the application.

# Technologies

- Knockout.js
- Javascript

# Challenges

The primary challenge of this application was getting the viewmodel to update whenever a different name of the cat was clicked. To work around this, we utilized methods like setCurrentCat, and getCurrentCat so that the view could understand which cat to display whenever one was clicked.
