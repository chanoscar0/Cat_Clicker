# Cat_Clicker

The purpose of this application was to explore the limits of front-end design methods like MVC, MVVM concepts.

THe first version of the Cat_Clicker application came as a self-brewed application for design concepts.

Afterwards, we were able to utilize the Knockout.js framework to better build out the application.
